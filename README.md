# Welcome to SevenSpeak!

A voice controlled game app of Seven where multiple players can play the game of Seven with voice commands on any Amazon Alexa supported device.

# How to play Seven?

One player is chosen to begin and then play proceeds clockwise around the table. Each player in turn rolls six dice and removes any combination of numbers that add up to seven. The aim is to score the highest possible total by adding together the numbers shown on the remaining dice.

The first player has the option of rolling up to three times on their turn. After each roll, they remove sets of dice that add up to seven (one or more sets may have to be removed), and all these dice are set aside and are not used again during the player's turn. Then the numbers on the remaining dice are used to calculate their score. The first player can either accept the score or they can choose to roll again. If they choose to roll again, and subsequently roll any combination of dice that total seven, those dice must be removed as well. The player may then keep their score after two rolls, or risk rolling one more time to increase their score.

All the following players take their turns in the same manner except that they are then limited to the same number of rolls, or fewer, that the first player took.

The round ends once all players have had a turn. The player to the left of the previous first player begins each new round.
